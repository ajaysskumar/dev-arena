# Instructions for blog shell
I need your help with the following content:

1. Create an entry for the blog topic in SiteMap.cs. Follow the existing blog entries as examples. Keep the date as any nearest Saturday (can be in the past).
2. Create an entry in sitemap.xml. Follow the existing blog entries as examples. Use the current date here.
3. Create a Razor file inside the Blog category folder with a short name for the blog topic (for example, if the topic is "Importance of Naming conventions in TDD" the Razor file name could be "TddNamingConventions.razor"). If it cannot be categorized, create a new category and place the Razor file inside it.
4. For image artifacts, create the same hierarchical directory in wwwroot under the images subfolder. Instead of a Razor file, create a folder (a blog can have multiple images); scope here is to create the folder only for now.
