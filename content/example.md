# Introduction to Induction Motor

## Overview

An **induction motor**, also known as an **asynchronous motor**, is one of the most commonly used types of electric motors in industrial and domestic applications. It operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where the electric current required to produce torque is generated by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding.

## Working Principle

The basic principle behind the induction motor is **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction**. When a three-phase supply is given to the stator, a rotating magnetic field (RMF) is produced. This field cuts the rotor conductors, and according to Faradayâ€™s law, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the rotor. As a result, current flows in the rotor, producing torque that causes it to rotate in the direction of the stator field.

## Key Components

- **Stator**: The stationary part that produces the rotating magnetic field.
- **Rotor**: The rotating part that is acted upon by the magnetic field.
- **Bearings**: Allow smooth rotation of the rotor.
- **Frame**: The outer shell that provides mechanical support and protection.

## Types of Induction Motors

Induction motors are primarily classified into two types:

1. **Squirrel Cage Induction Motor**  
   - Simple and rugged construction  
   - Common in household and industrial applications

2. **Slip Ring (Wound Rotor) Induction Motor**  
   - Used in applications requiring high starting torque  
   - Allows external resistance control during startup

## Advantages

- Simple and robust construction
- Low cost and maintenance
- High efficiency and reliability
- Wide range of power ratings

## Applications

- Fans and blowers
- Pumps and compressors
- Conveyors and elevators
- Household appliances
- Industrial machinery
