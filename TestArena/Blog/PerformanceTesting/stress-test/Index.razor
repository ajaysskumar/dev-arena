            Imagine this: It's the first day of summer reading programs at your public library. Your book tracking API is running smoothly, handling the usual 100 requests per minute for most borrowed books. Suddenly, thousands of excited children and parents start searching simultaneously for popular titles. Within minutes, the traffic surges to 1,000 requests per minute. Will your system maintain accuracy and responsiveness, or will it falter, leading to frustrated readers and inaccurate borrowing statistics?
        </p>
        <p>
            These scenarios aren't hypothetical. Libraries worldwide face similar challenges during peak periods like semester starts, summer reading programs, and popular book releases. The key to maintaining service quality? Thorough stress testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our previous article, we covered the basics of performance testing with K6. Today, we're diving deep into stress testing - your safeguard against system failures under extreme conditions. While load testing ensures your system works under expected conditions, stress testing pushes your system to and beyond its limits, helping you understand not just when it breaks, but how it breaks and, crucially, how it recovers.

    <Section Heading="💥 The Real Cost of Inadequate Stress Testing" Level="5">
        <p>
            Let's look at some real-world incidents that highlight the importance of thorough stress testing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>University Library System (2024):</strong> During final exams week, a major university's library system crashed when thousands of students simultaneously accessed the catalog for research materials. The result? Students couldn't locate crucial study materials, and librarians couldn't track borrowed books accurately.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Public Library Launch (2023):</strong> A metropolitan library's new digital catalog system failed during the summer reading program kickoff. The system wasn't adequately tested for concurrent access by hundreds of families, leading to incorrect availability information and frustrated patrons.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Best-Seller Release (2024):</strong> A regional library network's book tracking system experienced severe delays when a highly anticipated novel was released. Despite normal load testing, the real-world usage patterns of simultaneous holds and availability checks overwhelmed the system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These incidents share a common theme: systems that worked perfectly under normal conditions failed catastrophically when pushed beyond their limits. This is where stress testing becomes invaluable.

    <Section Heading="When to Use Stress Testing" Level="5">
        <p>
            Stress testing becomes essential when you need to validate your system's behavior under extreme conditions. Here are the critical scenarios where you should prioritize it:
        </p>
        <List Heading="Key Scenarios" HeadingLevel="5" ChildContents="@whenToUseStressTest" />
        
        <CalloutBox Type="Tip">
            Always test for at least 2x your highest expected load. If you're planning for 1000 users, test for 2000. It's better to be over-prepared than caught off guard.
        </CalloutBox>
    </Section>

    <Section Heading="Understanding Stress Test Stages" Level="5">
        <p>
            🌊 Think of stress testing like pressure testing a dam. You don't just flood it at maximum capacity immediately; you carefully increase the water levels while monitoring every crack and strain. Let's break down this methodical approach:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Baseline Stage:</strong> Like checking the dam at normal water levels, we start with your typical production load to establish normal performance metrics. This gives us a reference point for later comparison.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ramp-up Stages:</strong> Similar to gradually increasing water levels, we step up the load in controlled increments. This helps identify:
                <ul>
                    <li>When performance starts to degrade</li>
                    <li>How your scaling mechanisms respond</li>
                    <li>Which components show strain first</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Breaking Point Stage:</strong> This is where we push until something gives. Like finding a dam's maximum capacity, we need to know:
                <ul>
                    <li>The exact point where the system starts failing</li>
                    <li>Which components fail first</li>
                    <li>How the system behaves during failure</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Recovery Stage:</strong> Perhaps the most crucial stage. Like monitoring how a dam stabilizes after high water levels, we observe:
                <ul>
                    <li>How quickly the system returns to normal</li>
                    <li>Whether any permanent damage occurs</li>
                    <li>If all components recover properly</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <Section Heading="Implementing a Stress Test with K6" Level="5">
        <p>
            Let's work with our Most Borrowed Book API example. Sarah's team needs to stress test their book tracking API, which currently handles 100 requests per minute. They want to verify it can handle a 10x spike during peak usage periods. More importantly, they need to ensure that even if the system gets overwhelmed, it won't provide incorrect borrowing statistics or lose track of book availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll build upon our previous MostBorrowedBook API example to demonstrate these principles. Our stress test will simulate a gradual increase from normal load to well beyond expected peaks, while monitoring not just response times but also data integrity and system recovery.

        <Section Heading="Immediate Actions" Level="5">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Connection Pool Optimization:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased the database connection pool size</li>
                        <li>Implemented connection timeout retry logic</li>
                        <li>Added monitoring for pool utilization</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Caching Layer:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added Redis caching for frequently accessed data</li>
                        <li>Implemented cache warming during low-traffic periods</li>
                        <li>Set up cache hit ratio monitoring</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Circuit Breakers:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented graceful degradation for non-critical features (like "similar books" recommendations)</li>
                        <li>Added automatic recovery mechanisms</li>
                        <li>Set up alerts for circuit breaker triggers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Think of circuit breakers like a library's backup procedures: when the main catalog system is overwhelmed, you might temporarily switch to a basic search-only mode while keeping core book checkout functionality working.

    <Section Heading="Best Practices: Lessons from the Trenches" Level="5">
        <p>
            🏆 Through our library API testing and similar experiences from larger systems, we've compiled these battle-tested best practices. While our example focuses on a library system, these principles apply universally:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Start Small, Think Big:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Begin with baseline tests but plan for 10x your expected load. Netflix famously tests for 5x their Christmas Day traffic - their highest traffic day of the year.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Monitor the Full Stack:</strong>
                <p>
                    Don't just watch your application metrics. During the 2020 US election, major news sites stayed online by closely monitoring everything from CDN cache hits to database IOPS.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Test Recovery Thoroughly:</strong>
                <p>
                    Amazon's famous "chaos engineering" practices include testing not just if systems fail, but how they recover. Your recovery patterns are as important as your failure points.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use Production-Like Data:</strong>
                <p>
                    When Spotify stress tests new features, they use anonymized production data patterns to ensure realistic testing scenarios.

            ⚠️ Learn from these real-world stress testing mistakes:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The "Quick Warm-up" Trap:</strong>
                <p>
                    A major e-commerce site once concluded their system could handle Black Friday loads based on a 5-minute warm-up test. They learned the hard way that sustained load reveals issues that brief tests miss.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The "Perfect World" Fallacy:</strong>
                <p>
                    A payment processor tested their system with perfect network conditions, only to face issues when real-world latency and packet loss came into play.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The "Missing Metrics" Mystery:</strong>
                <p>
                    A streaming service couldn't figure out why their API was failing until they discovered they weren't monitoring their Redis cache eviction rates - a critical metric that explained their performance degradation.

        <p>
            Stress testing isn't just a technical exercise - it's about building confidence in your system's resilience. When done right, it transforms unknowns into knowns, anxiety into assurance, and potential disasters into manageable situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sarah's team launched their summer reading program successfully, handling 10x their normal load without a hiccup. More importantly, they now confidently serve their community knowing exactly how their system will behave during peak periods.
