        <p>Recently i came a across a situation where i had to explore contract testing using PACT framework.</p>

        <p>For some background, the account that i was working for had already implemented contract testing in their micro-services. They were following schema based contract testing approach.</p>

        <p>In short, schema based testing approach involves matching of the schema that consumers of an API are using against the said API provider. The example and images below will illustrate schema based testing using a small example scenario.</p>

        <p>Imagine a microservices system with 3 consumers (A, B and C) for a Provider API. Now all three consumers are expecting a certain fields for their use case from the Provider API. As long as Provider is able to maintain the contract expectations of the consumers, things will be fine.</p>

        <p>In schema based contract tests, the testing framework is responsible for getting the schemas of all the consumers and it also holds the current schema of the Provider service. The next step is the comparison which is show in images below.</p>
